# Harmonizer 01

Harmonizer 01 is a rule-based system that generates harmonized chord progressions according to classical harmony rules. It is implemented in SuperCollider and is the first iteration in a series exploring music-generation algorithms aimed at live performance tools.

Although still under development, the current version is fully usable: load the project source files and call `harmonizeProg` (see Usage below). It takes two mandatory argumentsâ€”a chord progression and a corresponding array of durationsâ€”and returns a harmonized progression that you can assign to a Routine, Task, or Pbind, to be played by any user-defined synth that accepts frequency and duration parameters.

The function also offers two optional flags: sustain (when true, holds common tones instead of repeating them) and direction (selects ascending, descending, or ranged chord motion).

Rather than evolving a single codebase across versions, this project advances through distinct iterations with narrow scope, keeping each one manageable. In Harmonizer 01, the emphasis is on the rule system and the backtracking algorithm. To reduce complexity, only triads are used, drawn from a static MIDI-note library, and a simple parser prepares the input progression for the backtracking stage.

The next iteration will introduce dynamically generated chord ranges (e.g., seventh chords, extended chords, augmented-sixth chords) and a more comprehensive parser.

## The Algorithm

The entry point is harmonizeProg, which requires:

* **progression**: an Array of Symbols (chord ciphers), and

* **durations**: an Array of Integers (one per chord).
Both arrays must have the same length.

The progression is parsed to extract and store per-chord data in a Dictionary: root, chord quality (major, minor, diminished, augmented), and the interval from the previous chordâ€™s root. During parsing, a specific rule profile is assigned to each chord to guide generation. The parser then collects chord data from the static library (MIDI-note ranges and degree arrays).

Before backtracking, these note ranges are filtered by voice range, andâ€”depending on the rules and the previous chordâ€”by (a) removing notes that violate melodic-interval constraints and (b) optionally collapsing candidates to the common tone when applicable. This filtering is repeated for each chord as backtracking traverses the progression.

Generation uses two nested backtracking loops. The inner loop builds all valid chord realizations for a given previous chord from the filtered note sets; the outer loop steps through the entire progression, trying candidate realizations in sequence. If at any point no valid realization can be foundâ€”or all candidates are exhaustedâ€”the algorithm backtracks to the last stable position, selects the next candidate, and continues.

On success, the function returns an array with two elements:

* `~result[0]` = arrays of MIDI notes per voice [Bass, Tenor, Alto, Soprano]

* `~result[1]` = arrays of durations per voice [Bass, Tenor, Alto, Soprano]

On occasion, the program might fail to generate a progression, in which case an error message is prompted. This is rare, and will be addressed over time as the rule profiling process matures. In these instances, the user may want to experiment with the `direction` parameter.

## Usage

Clone the repository and load the entry file:

```SuperCollider
"/local/path/to/harmonizer01/src/loadall.scd".loadRelative;
```

Then call the main function:

```SuperCollider
harmonizeProg.(progression, durations, direction: "line", sustain: true, score: false, logger: false)
```

#### Arguments

+ **progression** (Array of Symbols) â€“ chord progression to harmonize. Symbols must match the static library (see Valid chord symbols).

+ **durations** (Array of Integers) â€“ one duration per chord. Must match the length of progression.

+ **direction** (String, default "line") â€“ upper-voice motion: "up", "down", or "line" (ranged, centered on first chordâ€™s top note).

+ **sustain** (Boolean, default true) â€“ sustains common tones by extending the first noteâ€™s duration.

+ **score** (Boolean, default false) â€“ exports score via Python 3 + music21 + Finale/Sibelius/MuseScore.

+ **logger** (Boolean, default false) â€“ prints function call traces (debugging).

#### Example
```SuperCollider
~progression = ['CM', 'FM', 'GM', 'CM'];
~durations  = [2, 1, 1, 2];
~result = harmonizeProg.(~progression, ~durations);
```
#### Return format

```SuperCollider
[
    // MIDI notes per voice
    [ [..Bass..], [..Tenor..], [..Alto..], [..Soprano..] ],
    // durations per voice
    [ [..Bass..], [..Tenor..], [..Alto..], [..Soprano..] ]
]
```

You can then map each voice into a Pbind (see `main.scd` for a full example).

#### Valid chord symbols

| Root	| Diminished	| Minor	| Major	| Augmented |
| ----- | ------------- | ----- | ----- | --------- | 
| **C**  	| Cd        	| Cm	| CM	| CA        |
| **C#/Db**	| C#d        	| C#m	| DbM	| DbA       |
| **D**  	| Dd        	| Dm	| DM	| DA        |
| **Eb**	| Ebd        	| Ebm	| EbM	| EbA       |
| **E**  	| Ed        	| Em	| EM	| EA        |
| **F**  	| Fd        	| Fm	| FM	| FA        |
| **F#**	| F#d        	| F#m	| F#M	| F#A       |
| **G**  	| Gd        	| Gm	| GM	| GA        |
| **G#/Ab**	| G#d        	| G#m	| AbM	| AbA       |
| **A**  	| Ad        	| Am	| AM	| AA        |
| **Bb**	| Bbd        	| Bbm	| BbM	| BbA       |
| **B**  	| Bd        	| Bm	| BM	| BA        |

A more complete example is available in `main.scd`.

## Next Steps

Although the current version is functional, several areas require refinement before moving on to the next iteration:

* **Algorithmic efficiency** â€“ optimize backtracking and refine rule assignment to reduce unnecessary recursion.

* **Quality of progression** â€“ fine-tune rule profiles for higher musical quality.

* **Testing** â€“ expand unit testing for stability.

* **Score export** â€“ make the system OS-agnostic for easier use beyond the current Debian+Python setup.

* **Further documentation** â€“ extend documentation (possibly via a repository wiki) to explain subsystems and implementation choices in detail.
