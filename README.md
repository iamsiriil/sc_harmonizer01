# Harmonizer 01

Harmonizer 01 is thef first iteration in a series of projects aiming at exploring harmony genating algorithms with the ultimate end of creating a series of classes for Supercollider capable of generating harmonized progressions of chords that can then be assignd to routines to be played with any user generated synthethiser, capable of handling pitch and duration.


Being at the first stages of development, the program is set-up as a series of functions distributed throughout multiple files and follows a functional programming paradigm.
